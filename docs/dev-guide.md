# Developer Guide

## How to run

In initial state, run `npm install`. Afterwards, `npm run dev` each time.

## How to update contents

Update contents in these four places:
- *src/content/*      
    Markdowns like resume, and arrays like projects and skills.
- *public/*      
    Large static assets like videos.
- *src/assets/*  
    Small static assets like avatar.
- *src/config.ts*  
    Global constants like site name. Probably rarely needs change.

## How to pull and push

If set two remote hosts, one on Github, the other on Gitlab, need to do more than `git push`.

For example if have these in .git/config:

```txt
...
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/<github-account>/astro-comp.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/main
[remote "gitlab"]
	url = git@gitlab.com:<gitlab-account>/astro-comp.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/gitlab/*
...
```

, then we may want to usually only pull from GitHub primary.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

And push to both.

```bash
git push origin main
git push gitlab main
```

Can also add a global alias to push them both in one command (Powershell).

```bash
git config --global alias.pushall "!git push origin main && git push gitlab main"
```

This makes it less explicit though.

## Troubleshooting: Stuck Astro/Vite Dev Ports on Windows

Sometimes `Ctrl+C` does not fully terminate the Astro/Vite dev server on Windows, leaving ports such as `4321` occupied.

### Use WSL (most reliable)
Running the project inside WSL2/Linux generally avoids Windows process cleanup issues.

### Kill a specific port
Install:

```bash
npm install -g kill-port
```

Then:

```bash
kill-port 4321
```

### Find and kill the owning process manually

Find listening processes:

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr ":432" | findstr "LISTENING"
```

Kill by PID:

```powershell
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Kill all Node.js processes

```powershell
taskkill /IM node.exe /F
```

Useful when multiple stale Vite/Astro processes remain alive.

## Visual Tweaks: 3D Gallery

The gallery is split across two files:
- `src/components/GalleryCanvas.svelte` — layout, materials, animation, label strip
- `src/components/HalftoneShader.js` — GLSL vertex + fragment shader for the hex overlay

### Card layout (`GalleryCanvas.svelte`)

| Variable | Location | Current value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `COLS` | line ~61 | `3` | Number of columns in the grid |
| `GAP_X` | line ~62 | `0.28` | Horizontal gap between cards (Three.js units) |
| `GAP_Y` | line ~63 | `0.48` | Vertical gap between cards |
| `CARD_W` / `CARD_H` | line ~56–57 | `1.0` | Card face dimensions |
| `CARD_D` | line ~58 | `0.15` | Card thickness |
| `LABEL_H` | line ~77 | `0.22` | Height of the label strip plane (Three.js units) |
| `LABEL_GAP` | line ~78 | `0.04` | Gap between card bottom and label strip |

### Card animation (`GalleryCanvas.svelte`)

| Variable | Current value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `PARALLAX_STRENGTH` | `0.35` | How far the card group shifts with mouse movement |
| `HOVER_SCALE` | `1.2` | Scale multiplier when a card is hovered |
| `LERP_SPEED` | `0.12` | Smoothing speed for parallax and hover transitions |
| jiggle `* 0.04` / `* 0.05` | — | Rotation amplitude on X/Y axes during idle float |
| float `* 0.03` | — | Vertical float amplitude |
| `REVEAL_SPEED` | `0.025` | How fast the reveal wave expands per frame on hover (~0.67s to full at 60fps) |
| `REVEAL_MAX` | `1.0` | Max reveal radius in UV space (1.0 covers full card from center) |

### Side face material (`GalleryCanvas.svelte`)

The `sideMat` (`MeshStandardMaterial`) is defined inline per card:

| Property | Current value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `color` | `0xa8c7e0` | Base tint of the card edges |
| `opacity` | `0.45` | Transparency of the edges |
| `roughness` | `0.4` | Surface roughness (lower = more reflective) |
| `metalness` | `0.3` | Metallic sheen amount |

### Hex overlay shader (`GalleryCanvas.svelte` uniforms + `HalftoneShader.js`)

| What | Where | Current value | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overlay opacity | `uAlpha` uniform in `makeShaderMat` | `0.50` | How opaque the hex overlay is over the base image (0 = invisible, 1 = fully covers) |
| Hover brightness lift | `uHover * 0.25` in shader | `0.25` | Additive brightness added when hovered |
| Hex cell size | `hexSize` in fragment shader | `0.03` | Hex "radius" in UV space — smaller = more detail, larger = more stylized |
| Noise displacement amount | `noiseAmt` in fragment shader | `0.03` | How far each hex's sample point drifts |
| Noise scale | `noiseScale` in fragment shader | `3.0` | Spatial frequency of the Perlin noise pattern |
| Noise speed | `noiseSpeed` in fragment shader | `0.35` | How fast the noise animates (multiplied by `uTime`) |

### Label strip (`GalleryCanvas.svelte`)

The label is drawn onto a `256 × LCH px` Canvas2D texture. All values are in canvas pixels.

| Variable | Current value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `LCH` | `56` | Total canvas height — increase if text is clipped |
| `NAME_Y` | `20` | Baseline Y for the project name text |
| `TAGS_Y` | `44` | Baseline Y for tag pill text |
| Strip `globalAlpha` | `0.5` | Background transparency of the whole strip |
| Strip `fillStyle` | `#5e656b` | Strip background color |
| Name `fillStyle` | `#e8f0f8` | Project name text color |
| Name `shadowBlur` | `2` | Shadow softness behind project name (0 = none) |
| Tag pill `fillStyle` | `#b0b8d0` | Tag pill background color |
| Tag text `fillStyle` | `#253545` | Tag text color |
