# Astro Compact

Minimalistic style personal portfolio website. Not really a template, but feel free to strip away my info and use this as a starter for your own portfolio site.

## How to run

In initial state, run `npm install`. Afterwards, `npm run dev` each time.

## How to update contents

Update contents in these four places:
- *src/content/*      
    Markdowns like resume, and arrays like projects.
- *public/*      
    Large static assets like videos.
- *src/assets/*  
    Small static assets like avatar.
- *src/config.ts*  
    Global constants like site name. Probably rarely needs change.
